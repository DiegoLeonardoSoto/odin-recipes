    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My chicken tortilla soup is not a fast recipe, but it is one of the
      greatest chicken soup experiences known to man. The smoky, spicy, slowly
      simmered tomato chicken broth is made from scratch, and the soup is topped
      with all your favorite garnishes: toasted tortilla strips, sour cream,
      avocado, cilantro, lime, and crumbled Mexican cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine chicken, 1 onion, stems from the cilantro bunch, bay leaves,
          oregano, peppercorns, dried chili pods, and 3 quarts of water in a
          large soup pot set over medium-high heat. Bring to simmer, lower heat
          to medium-low, and simmer for 1 hour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, make the tortilla strips: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
          (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment
          paper.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cut tortillas in half, and then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips.
          Transfer tortilla strips to the prepared baking sheet and drizzle with
          oil. Add salt and toss well to coat, then spread strips out as evenly
          as possible.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crispy, tossing once
          or twice during the cooking time, about 30 minutes. Set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Carefully remove chicken to a bowl. Reduce heat on broth to low.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let chicken rest until cool enough to pull off the meat. Shred chicken
          and refrigerate until needed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add bones, skin, and all the scraps back to the pot of broth, and
          simmer on low heat for about 4 hours total. If broth reduces too much,
          just add a splash of water.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, after about 2 hours, make the charred vegetable salsa:
          Preheat on the oven’s broiler for high heat and set a rack about 8
          inches below the heating element. Line a baking sheet with foil and
          oil lightly; place remaining 2 onions, tomatoes, sweet red pepper, and
          jalapeno pepper on the prepared baking sheet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Broil vegetables until charred, 7 to 10 minutes. Add charred
          vegetables to the jar of a blender with garlic cloves, chipotle
          pepper, and 1 cup water, and blend until smooth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pour pureed salsa into the pot, and raise heat to medium-low. Simmer
          broth for another 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Pass soup through a
          fine mesh strainer into a separate pot, squeezing the chicken to get
          all those nice juices; discard bones and skin in strainer. Season soup
          to taste with salt.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add cumin, shredded chicken, and juice from 1 lime. Simmer 15 to 30
          minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste for seasoning, and serve with
          crispy tortilla strips. Garnish with sour cream, avocado, chopped
          cilantro, grated or crumbled Mexican cheese, additional lime juice,
          and a sprinkle of cayenne, if desired.
        </p>
