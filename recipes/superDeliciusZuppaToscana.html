    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1 large onion, diced</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1 tablespoon minced garlic</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>6 medium potatoes, thinly sliced</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1 cup heavy cream</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over
          medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15
          minutes. Drain and set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about
          10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the
          bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook
          until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes
          and simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium;
          stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until
          spinach has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve.
